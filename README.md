# SCDS: Learning Contractive Dynamical Imitation Policies

Imitating expert demonstrations with stability and predictability through learning a dynamical system has long been the center of attention. Yet, training a dynamical system to achieve stability and safety often required access to both states and its time derivative (eg, position and velocity). We propose leveraging the recently introduced Recurrent Equilibrium Networks (RENs) to achieve *state-only* imitation while providing global asymptotic stability through contraction theory. The approach hinges on differentiable ODE solvers, invertible coupling layers, and theoretical upper bounds for out-of-sample recovery.

## 🗃 Repository structure

The [source](source/) folder contains the majority of model architectures and data manipulation files. The rest of the repo can be summarized as follows:

```bash
    ├── source       # Python source files of the project
    |   ├── model    # Model implementations
    |   ├── misc     # Plot and miscellaneous
    |   ├── sim      # Simulation files
    |   └── data     # Dataloader for LASA and Robomimic
    |
    ├── exp          # Batch experimentation files
    ├── data         # Figures and other data, including trained policies
    ├── CONTRIBUTING.md
    └── README.md
```


## ⚙️ Basic setup

The following command should automatically install a working version of the repository, without robotic simulations. The robomimic repository needs to be installed separately via [the installation guide](https://robomimic.github.io/docs/introduction/installation.html).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

➡️ This is sufficient to train policies on Robomimic and LASA datasets, and visualize the results like the following.

## 📦 Docker setup (optional)
Our docker image is the modified version of the [Nvidia Isaac Sim docker](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_container.html), nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:4.2.0. It is required to do robotic simulations with Franka and Jackal robots.

📝 Setting up the Docker image is optional, and is required to have Isaac Lab robot simulations.
To reduce the overhead of installing different simulators and environments, we already published a docker file containing all the required tools and libraries to run this codebase, and also to use Isaac Lab simulator.

### Pull docker image from DockerHub

Pull the following docker image, which already includes all required packages.

```bash
docker pull aabyaneh750/scds:1.0
```

Execute the docker and link clone this repo in ```isaac_sim``` directory. The following command ensures the GPU is set up properly.

```bash
docker run --name satriales  --entrypoint bash -ti -d --runtime=nvidia
    -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" --rm --network=host -e "PRIVACY_CONSENT=Y"
    -v ~/docker/isaac-sim/cache/kit:/isaac-sim/kit/cache:rw

## 🚀 Getting started

### Training

```bash
# LASA expert data
python train.py --model-type discrete --device cuda:0 --total-epochs 500 --expert lasa --motion-shape Worm --num-expert-trajectories 1

# Robomimic expert data
python train.py --model-type discrete --expert "robomimic" --motion-shape "lift"  --dim-in 3 --dim-out 3 --device cuda:0  --total-epochs 500 --bijection --num-bijection-layers 8 --crate-lb 12.0  --num-expert-trajectories 1 --horizon 20 --loss dtw
```

By default, the results of experiments are stored in a folder called *boards*.

### Testing and plots

```bash
python test.py --load-model data/trained_policy/dren-lasa-Worm-h50-x64-e15000-b16-cr1.0-e1-s50-a0-t11-0839/best_model.pth
```

## 🎛 Command line parameters

To enable curious readers of our work to explore different setups, we provide access to a comprehensive set of model and experiment parameters through the command line interface. ```cli.py``` encompasses all these options, and a summary of key items is shown below.

### Train parameters

Use the following command to get the full list of possible arguments.

```bash
python train.py --help
```

The key arguments are summarized below.

```bash
  # model
  --model-type MODEL_TYPE

### Test parameters

A summary of key parameters may be found in the following. We use the same CLI interface for train and test to remain consistent, but that means there are some train parameters which remain unused during test and vice versa.

```bash
  --num-test-rollouts NUM_TEST_ROLLOUTS
                        Number of test rollouts for plots.
  --ic-test-std IC_TEST_STD
                        Initial condition std during test and plotting phase.
  --load-model LOAD_MODEL
                        If it is not set to None, a pretrained model will be loaded instead of training.
  --legends             Add legend to the plots.
  --new-ic-test         Load the saved initial conditions for consistency with other baselines.
```


## 🚧 REN implementations
